// the composer in the empty-chat hero (renderEmptyHero in screens/session.js).
// Each card maps to a REAL Archie capability and is one of three kinds:
//   • `prompt`     — clicking pre-fills the composer with an editable prompt.
//                    The `{{source}}` / `{{video-source}}` placeholders are
//                    resolved at render time to the first attached (video)
//                    source filename, or the literal "your source" / "your
//                    video" for first-run users.
//   • `action`     — clicking launches a guided flow instead of injecting text.
//                    Handled in session.js's starter click delegation:
//                      - "open-batch"       → Batch Studio source-intake screen

//                    soon" badge. No prompt/action fires on click.
//
// `subtitle` + `cta` drive the visible card copy; `prompt` is still carried on

  // ── Alliance Jiu Jitsu Carlsbad ──────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // Added to back the Content Research lane built from the real Agorapulse
  // listening export (see researchLanes / researchBriefs at the bottom of this
  // file). A lane card reads its Playbook's name and colour, so without a
  // matching Playbook the jiu-jitsu lane would have claimed to belong to
  // Pawtrack.
  //
  // TWO sources, kept separate on purpose — the same discipline as ctx-noba:
  //
  //   • The STRATEGY (objective, positioning, competitors, pillars, the
  //     "explain the mechanism, not the milestone" angle) comes from the
  //     listening export: "drive local brand awareness and free trial
  //     sign-ups", elite coaching, safety-first culture, youth development
  //     over aggressive fighters, and the three named local academies.
  //
  //   • Everything BRAND-side (voice, hooks, formatting, palette, type,
  //     programs, the offer, links) was read off alliancecarlsbad.com and the
  //     two social accounts on 18 Aug 2026. Site copy is quoted or paraphrased
  //     close to verbatim: "Train Hard. Stay Humble", "Train with Purpose.
  //     Belong to Something Bigger", "no ego, no intimidation", the free
  //     30-minute one-on-one introduction, and "Since opening in 2017".
  //
  // The palette and type stack are OBSERVED, not guessed: computed styles off
  // the live homepage give Teko 600 uppercase headings over Ubuntu 300 body,
  // and #FFC20E on near-black as the only accent. Elementor's own global
  // colour variables were ignored — that theme ships #61CE70/#54595F as
  // untouched defaults and the site never paints with them.
  //
  // Still empty, deliberately: brandLogo (the real files are remote WordPress
  // uploads behind Cloudflare, and every other Playbook points at a local
  // assets/ path), referenceImages, imageVoice, and influencers — the export
  // collected competitor posts only and the site names no creators.
  //
  // ⚠️ One honest tension worth keeping visible: the voice below is the one
  // the STRATEGY argues for — patient, mechanism-first, never hypes results.
  // The live Instagram does not always sound like that ("🏆 14X WORLD
  // CHAMPION…", "Hey Alliance Carlsbad fam!"). The dontRules name that gap
  // rather than paper over it.

  //   • Everything BRAND-side (positioning, voice, audience, strategy) comes
  //     from nobalifestyle.com — the tagline "Dress with class, for less", the
  //     founding-by-two-brothers story, and the "quiet, confident, built to

  //
  // Left deliberately empty rather than invented: brandColors, brandTypography,

  // read, and guessing them would put fake hexes into a Playbook that claims to

  // ── Agorapulse ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // The third Playbook built from a real listening export rather than authored
  // for this prototype — search `agorapulse`, scope 23 Apr 2025 → 21 Jul 2026,
  // networks Instagram + Facebook + web blogs, 117 items (50 IG / 21 FB / 46 WB).
  // It backs lane-6 below.
  //
  // Unusually, that export carried its OWN brand brief — the block the model was
  // given to decide which subjects qualify — so the business summary, audiences,
  // content styles, objectives, actions and competitors below are transcribed
  // from it rather than inferred. Only the URLs are added from agorapulse.com,
  // because the export names no links.
  //
  // ⚠️ The brief names four competitors (Sprout Social, Hootsuite, Sendible,
  // Loomly) but the scan actually collected posts from Hootsuite, Buffer, Vista
  // Social, Sprinklr and Sprout Social. Both sets are listed, tagged for which
  // is which — a competitor the brand names and a competitor the scan keeps
  // finding are different facts and neither should overwrite the other.
  // Built from a real Agorapulse listening export — search `dwelling`, scope
  // 16 Jun → 16 Jul 2026, Instagram only, 45 items. Every field below the
  // audience comes from the export's own brand brief; the website, the MEP and
  // factory figures, the energy standards and the contact routes are from
  // thedwellingcompany.com.
  //
  // ── The one thing worth knowing before demoing this Playbook ──────────────
  // The brand is a US developer and its brand brief names US competitors
  // (Factory_OS, Autovol, Module, Vessel). The 45 posts the scan actually
  // returned are from BELGIAN and Luxembourgish regional homebuilders —
  // Sibomat, Stabilame, Thomas & Piron, Maisons Blavier, Naturhome, Mi Casa.
  // None of the four named competitors appears once.
  //
  // That mismatch is kept rather than tidied away, because it is the most
  // instructive thing in the export: the search matched a WORD, not a market,
  // and the topics Archie produced are consequently about timber and on-site
  // customisation — the opposite of steel and factory completion. A demo that
  // silently repointed the accounts would hide the failure mode this lane is
  // the best example of.

  //
  // Two sources, kept separate — the same discipline as ctx-alliance-bjj and
  // ctx-noba:
  //
  //   • The STRATEGY (objective, competitors, pillars, the "lead with the job
  //     removed" angle) comes from the listening export — see the notes on
  //     `strategy.pillars` below, which record which model run produced what.
  //
  //   • Everything BRAND-side (voice, hooks, formatting, palette, type, the
  //     proof numbers, the links) was read off agorapulse.com and the blog on
  //     18 Aug 2026. Site copy is quoted or near-verbatim: "Keep tabs, without
  //     switching tabs", "Drive Real Impact on Social Media. From Engagement to
  //     ROI.", "the internal friction and downright annoyance of having to send
  //     multiple emails", and the four proof figures (50% / 30% / 96% / 30 min).
  //     Founding facts — Paris, 2010, Emeric Ernoult and Benoît Hédiard,
  //     bootstrapped, first social inbox in 2014 — are public record.
  //
  // The palette and type are OBSERVED off the live homepage, not guessed, and
  // they line up with what the design system ships: Averta throughout, #212E44
  // navy as text and brand, #FF6726 orange for emphasis, #1863DC blue for the
  // action. Note the app's own convention is the reverse of the marketing
  // site's (orange = AI, blue = routine) — see CLAUDE.md; these values describe
  // agorapulse.com, not the product UI.
  //
  // Still empty, deliberately: brandLogo (every other Playbook points at a
  // local assets/ path and no local file exists), referenceImages, imageVoice,
  // and influencers — the export collected competitor posts only, and the
  // creators and advocates Agorapulse actually works with are not something the
  // website states, so naming them here would be invention.

Founded in Paris in 2010 by Emeric Ernoult and Benoît Hédiard and bootstrapped since, it shipped the first social media inbox in 2014 and now serves 31K+ social media managers daily. The site argues on four numbers rather than adjectives: 50% of content-creation time saved, 30% average saving for teams switching, 96% user satisfaction, and support answering in 30 minutes or less. Social ROI is the differentiator it claims outright — tracking sales, traffic and leads back to organic posts.",

Sprout barely mentions AI at all this month — their feed is Cannes, the World Cup and an awards programme.\n\nThe gap is the same one in every account: they describe the architecture and never name the task that stops arriving.

  // ── lane-4 · from the real Alliance Jiu Jitsu Carlsbad listening export ────

  // These four briefs are the four topics that model gemini-3.5-flash returned
  // in that export, with its own headlines, "Why now" lines, volume figures,
  // network mixes, keyword sets and item counts. The articles condense its
  // long-form output while keeping its argument and its language.
  //
  // Why only one model's topics: the export is a MODEL COMPARISON — three models
  // each proposed 3–4 topics over the same 25 posts, so the sets overlap heavily
  // (all three found the youth-development and belt-promotion themes). Taking one
  // model's set gives a feed without near-duplicates. gemini-3.5-flash is the one
  // that returned four rather than three.
  //
  // Two honest gaps, both from the export rather than from choice:
  //   • posts: [] — the export carries no source posts, only per-topic item
  //     COUNTS. Inventing authors and engagement numbers would fake the very
  //     evidence a brief exists to show, so the arrays are empty and the counts
  //     live in whyNowDetail instead.
  //   • ageLabel is the same on all four. They came out of one scan (the export's
  //     window closes 2026-07-31 05:34), so they genuinely share an age.
  //
  // isTrending is DERIVED from the export's own `Volume:` field — high → trending,
  // medium → not. That is the closest thing it gives to a baseline comparison.

        "Across the tracked Carlsbad academies, youth programs are being sold on character: kind, confident, capable children, sometimes from age four. The shift is a good one, and it is now the category default rather than a differentiator. What none of the posts do is answer the hesitation that actually stops a parent signing up — whether martial arts will teach their child to settle conflict with their fists.",
        "That question has a real answer, and it is structural rather than cultural. Most martial arts are striking arts: they train a child to meet conflict with immediate outward aggression. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is grappling — leverage, technique and control. A child is taught to neutralise a threat, control a situation and escape safely, which is a fundamentally different instinct to rehearse. Every movement is cause and effect, so the training rewards keeping a cool head and thinking, not swinging.",
        "The mat culture is the other half of it. A child who does not feel safe cannot build resilience — an environment that is chaotic or overly competitive puts them in survival mode, and character development stops there. The clearest expression of the opposite is the tap: when a partner taps, everything stops, immediately and without exception. That single rule teaches respect for someone else's boundaries and that it is safe to admit you are caught. Strength is for protecting and controlling, never for intimidating.",
        "This is also why capable children fight least. Bullying runs on insecurity in both directions — the aggressor proving dominance, the target projecting fear. A child who knows with certainty that they could control a confrontation, and do it without hurting anyone, has nothing left to prove. That is the angle the local conversation has left open: not that character development matters, but how it is actually produced.",

Children move white, grey, yellow, orange, green, earning up to four stripes inside each rank. Those stripes are the mechanism worth talking to parents about: for a young child a year is an eternity, and stripes break an intimidating goal into phases small enough to feel. Each one is a signal that daily effort is compounding.",
        "The reason it works is that the recognition is earned rather than given. A promotion arrives after a child has worked through frustration, refined something they were bad at, and shown up disciplined when they were tired. That teaches the thing empty praise cannot: that their success sits entirely inside their own control. Confidence built that way does not break when life produces a setback.",
        "The mats behave like a laboratory for that. A student chasing a stripe will hit plateaus — a position they cannot escape, a newer partner who suddenly gives them trouble — and with decent coaching they learn to read those as information rather than failure. The question shifts to 'what do I do differently next time?'. Children who discover that consistency produces progression on the mats start applying it to schoolwork without being told to.",
        "There is a practical parent angle here too, and it is a corrective. The instinct is to compare — why did another child get a stripe first?

  //
  // Three topics over the 112 Instagram posts in `noba_fashion_competitors_posts_
  // last30days` (4 July – 3 August 2026, five competitor accounts). Headline,
  // summary and article are the generation output as written against ctx-noba —
  // kept as produced, with the article's section headings folded into paragraphs
  // because the research view renders prose only.
  //
  // `posts` carries the export's own items — author, date, text, engagement as
  // exported — matched under the topic their text supports. `reposts` is 0
  // throughout because the export's shares column is empty, not because it was
  // measured. All three share an ageLabel: they came out of one scan.

      paragraphs: [
        "You know the feeling: the mornings already feel surprisingly crisp, while the afternoon sun warms up the terrace again. In fashion stores and across social media, heavy autumn collections and winter coats are already being pushed everywhere. Yet it is far too early to permanently banish your favorite summer items to the attic.",
        "The secret to effortless style during this transitional period lies not in hastily purchasing a complete autumn wardrobe, but in masterfully combining light layers. As a Belgian multi-brand expert, we at Noba Fashion know how quickly our climate can shift. With a few cleverly chosen basic pieces from our wide brand selection, you can transform your summer outfits into autumn-proof combinations in no time.",
        "A successful transitional look relies on garments that adapt easily to temperature fluctuations. Lightweight knitwear is the ultimate in-between piece: a finely knit cardigan or a thin cotton sweater goes over a summer dress or top in the morning, and around your shoulders as soon as the sun breaks through. Timeless denim and light trousers form the foundation — enough protection against a cool breeze, and they pair effortlessly with both sunny tops and autumn blazers. And a versatile mid-season jacket, whether a classic trench coat, a denim jacket or a refined overshirt, instantly elevates any look while staying practical for life on the go.",
        "Fashion is about smart combinations, not monthly overhauls. An airy summer dress gains an instant autumnal feel layered under a tailored blazer, with open sandals swapped for closed-toe shoes or ankle boots. A sleeveless summer top carries over just as easily under a fluid button-down shirt worn open as a light jacket. Combining different brands within a single outfit gives you the freedom to refine your personal style — functional for the morning rush, elegant for work, comfortable for the weekend.",
        "The Belgian autumn requires flexibility. By resisting the urge to jump straight into heavy winter wear and focusing instead on thoughtful transitional layers, you get the absolute most out of your closet. With a few strong foundational elements from our multi-brand selection, you can step out the door every morning with confidence — no matter what your weather app predicts.",

      paragraphs: [
        "Red stickers, aggressive discounts up to -70%, and slogans shouting 'now or never': the final sale weeks can be overwhelming. The pitfall of this period is well known — you come home with garments that were fantastically discounted, only for them to sit at the back of your closet after a single wear because they match nothing else you own.",
        "At Noba Fashion, we take a different view of sales. We don't see them as a hunt for as many cheap items as possible, but as the moment to secure high-quality multi-brand classics that will last for years. With a targeted approach, an impulsive shopping trip becomes a sustainable upgrade to your wardrobe.",
        "A successful sale purchase meets three simple criteria: the fit is perfect, the quality is exceptional, and the item fits seamlessly into your daily lifestyle. Ask yourself with every item whether you would consider buying it at full price — if the answer is yes, you have found a genuine gem. During the final markdowns that points at three categories: a timeless, well-cut blazer in a neutral shade such as navy, sand or black; high-quality jeans or trousers from a top brand with a great fit; and classic knitwear and blouses — crisp white shirts, finely knit wool or cotton sweaters, neatly finished tops.",
        "The great advantage of a multi-brand store is being able to compare and combine pieces from different quality brands side by side. A capsule wardrobe is ideally around ten well-coordinated garments you can mix and match effortlessly. Searching for neutral color palettes during the sales — warm beige, grey, deep blue, olive green — is what makes new additions integrate with what is already in your closet, and what removes the familiar 'I have nothing to wear' frustration on a busy morning.",
        "Shopping with a plan brings peace of mind. Instead of getting lost in overcrowded racks filled with fleeting trends, a thoughtful shopping visit helps you build a reliable wardrobe you can count on. Style isn't about the quantity of clothes in your closet, but about the quality and versatility of the pieces you wear — which is how you walk away from the final sale weeks with true long-term value rather than buyer's remorse.",

      paragraphs: [
        "As summer days shorten, the fashion world's color palette transforms. This season sees a clear shift toward deep, warm tones that exude luxury and calm. The absolute showstopper of this autumn is plum — a refined, deep brownish-pink shade — accompanied by warm earth tones like rust brown, chocolate and soft terracotta.",
        "While these rich colors look stunning on mannequins, many women wonder how to translate this trend into their own daily wardrobes. Nobody wants to purchase a head-to-toe outfit that feels dated after a single season. At Noba Fashion, we show you how to introduce these trend colors subtly and stylishly.",
        "Plum serves as the perfect bridge between classic and modern: it has the warmth of brown and the softness of pink, which makes it a surprisingly accessible color for virtually every skin tone. Wear it as a stylish accent — a plum handbag, belt or scarf against grey trousers and a white blouse — or as a statement top, a fluid blouse or knit sweater with your trusted blue jeans, which gives an everyday look extra character without feeling over-the-top. For those who want to make a statement, tone-on-tone with soft pink or warm brown is softer than black-and-white and remarkably elegant.",
        "Alongside plum, rich earth tones form the foundation for a harmonious autumn look, and the key to wearing them lies in playing with textures. A warm brown suede skirt paired with a smooth cotton top, or a rust-colored cardigan layered over a denim shirt, creates engaging visual dynamics that a single flat color cannot. The benefit of a wide multi-brand selection is that different shades of brown and plum from various brands sit side by side in one place, so you find the exact nuance that makes your complexion glow.",
        "Fashion should remain fun and, above all, fit who you are. You don't need to reinvent your entire style to follow the latest trends: adding just one or two key pieces in plum or a warm earth tone gives your familiar outfits a fresh, contemporary appeal. With the right balance between striking trend colors and timeless basics, you can step out the door this autumn feeling confident and stylish.",

  // ── The gemini-3.5-flash-lite pass over the July Carlsbad scan ────────────
  // Second export against the same search that seeded lane-4 (alliance_jiujitsu_
  // carlsbad, 1–31 July 2026, Instagram + Facebook, 25 items / 18 IG / 7 FB) —
  // this time a model comparison, three passes over the identical post set.
  //
  // The flash-lite pass returned TWO topics, and one of them (youth character
  // development, 8 items) is already on this lane as br-10, so it is not
  // duplicated here. Only its second topic is new: br-22. The remaining four
  // come from the flash and 3.6-flash passes over the same posts, skipping belt
  // progression because br-11 already covers it. Everything below — volume
  // bands, network splits, item counts, keywords — is read off the export
  // rather than invented; the prose is written for this Playbook's voice
  // (calm, expert, safety-first; explains the mechanism before it sells).
  //
  // These five also give lane-4 a spread of review statuses. Every brief the
  // lane had was seedStatus "new", so Saved / Used / Ignored had nothing to show.
  // All three of those land on ready-to-post briefs deliberately: the TYPE filter
  // would have been invisible on a fresh mount and the spread would only exist
  // in the data.

//
// A Playbook needs no `widgets` here — its Performance section already has the
// full PLAYBOOK_REPORT under the lead.

// The metrics the Playbook's report shows, and where each one sits in it.

// The report is fixed: always the same six metrics, in the same places. It's a
// summary the Playbook owns, not a canvas the reader builds — so there's nothing
// to pin, resize or choose, and no state behind it.
//
// Which six isn't a free choice either. A Playbook spans every network it
// publishes to, so a metric only some networks report would read as a hole
// rather than a number: Reach is a Facebook/Instagram idea, link clicks skip
// Instagram and TikTok, video views only mean something where the post was a
// video. The six here are the ones every network answers — which is why four of
// them are exactly what Agorapulse aggregates across profiles (audience,
// engagement, impressions, published), plus the rate and the growth derived from
// those. The per-network specifics are what the locked row below teases.
//
// The numbers hold together on purpose: 3,410 engagements on 84,200 impressions
// IS the 4.1% rate, and +1,240 on a 23,620 base IS the +5.3% audience move. A
// summary whose own cards contradict each other reads as decoration.

// three S widgets, then the chart at M with two S stacked to its left.
//

//   ├─────┤     M     │   cols 4-9 rows 4-9
//   │  S  │           │   cols 1-3 rows 7-9
//   └─────┴───────────┘
//
// An S card is title + value + variation, so that's all it carries. `total` is
// the chart's business — it's what the series get split out of — and the chart
// card shows no headline number, so it carries no value or variation.
//
// `count` is the figure, unformatted — the ported formatCompactNumber decides how it
// reads, so the report and the Insights hub cannot disagree about the same number.
// `total` is a different quantity: what the widget's chart sums to over the 30 days.

// Per-Playbook overrides of the six metrics below, and the reason they exist: the
// six were authored once and read identically for every Playbook, so a portfolio
// view drilling into two of them showed the same numbers twice. Same shape and

//
// Ported from the design doc "Insights Flow" — one page, three tabs, one panel
// that changes job. What lives here is the COPY the doc authors and nothing that
// can be derived: a Playbook's score, its verdict and the rail's order all come
// out of objective-scoring.js over OBJECTIVE_METRICS, which is where the doc's own
// rail order (47 · 59 · 72 · 74 · 79 · 84 · 88) came from in the first place.
//
// ── Three portfolio figures had to be reconciled, 2026-08-25 ────────────────
// The doc's three tabs each stated their own portfolio totals and no two agreed:
// Performance said "18 posts" over 30 days, Usage's rail summed to 318, and Value
// claimed 412,000 reached against Performance's 42,300. Same account, same month.
// A page whose whole argument is "these numbers hold up in front of a boss" cannot
// print two answers to "how many posts did we publish".
//
// Resolved on the figure each tab can actually defend:
//   · posts published = 318, because the Usage rail's seven rows sum to it and
//     Acme's panel alone claims 89;
//   · reach = 412,000, the order of magnitude 318 posts implies (42,300 was
//     authored back when the account had four Playbooks);
//   · drafting time saved = posts × 9 min, DERIVED — the doc's own Alliance panel
//     does that arithmetic (16 posts → ~2.5 h) and its portfolio "~14 h" did not.
//     318 posts is ~48 h;
//   · reach is not authored here AT ALL. Both candidate totals (42,300 and 412,000)
//     traced to nothing the reader could click — no panel below them summed to
//     either. It is the sum of the reach objectives the Playbooks actually declare,
//     computed in insights-model.js, so every summand is one click away in the rail.
//     Smaller than the doc's figure and checkable, which is the trade this page is
//     built to make.
// Everything else the strips show is derived: "9 / 13 objectives on pace" is a
// count of objectives whose tier is not At risk, and it already matched the doc.

//
// `voice` is per Playbook and not per account: the doc's panel says "the voice
// Archie learned HERE", and a single account-wide voice was the thing that made the
// old tab read as flattery rather than evidence.
