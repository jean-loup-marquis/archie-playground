// Content Research — one Topic feed, route /topic-feeds/:id.
//
// VOCABULARY: the UI says Topic feed (a lane) and Topic (a brief/"topic"). The
// code below keeps lane/brief/topic throughout — see CLAUDE.md's vocabulary note.
// Comments in this file predate the rename and still say "topic" for a Topic.
//
// The generating loader runs on ARRIVAL FROM ELSEWHERE only, keyed on ?fresh=1,
// which both the lane list's open action and the form's save append. Returning
// from the trending page or from settings carries no param and so paints
// straight away — re-running a 1.6s spinner on a back button is punishment, not
// feedback.
//
// Filtering is ONE control: the Filters panel, three groups — Topic type, Topic
// status, Sources — in that order. Its badge counts NARROWED GROUPS, not ticked
// options (see briefs-store.narrowedGroupCount).
//
// Topic type was briefly an always-visible chip row under the header, on the
// argument that the axis which changes a card's action should never be hidden.
// It went back in the panel because the row cost about 48px — a whole card line
// above the fold — to keep two checkboxes on screen, and the card's own tag
// already says which type it is. Defaults: both types, all sources, and New +
// Saved of the four statuses — Used and Ignored are answers the reader has already
// given, so the feed does not open on finished work (research-catalog has the why).
//
// The two ATTENTION SIGNALS — trending and updated — are NOT overrides in this
// feed: a brief carrying either appears under its own review status and
// disappears when that status is unticked. /attention is where they ignore
// triage. Keeping that split is the whole reason they are a notice here rather
// than a section.
//
// The notice counts every flagged topic in the lane and breaks that down by
// signal. It deliberately does NOT track what the filter hides or what you have
// already looked at — both were tried and removed. Nothing overrides the filter
// either; the feed's list stays exactly what the filter says it is.

// How long the mock generation appears to run. The handoff's ~1.6s: long enough
// to register that I'm doing work, short enough that nobody waits for it.
// ── One list, grouped by age ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This was two columns — "Content strategy" left, "Ready to post" right — and the
// split has moved onto the card as a tag. The reasoning is in
// SPEC-OPTION-B.md, but the short version is that the columns asserted a
// FALLIBLE AI classification as a fact of the layout: a column header cannot
// offer you a way to disagree with it, and the card's dropdown can.
//
// Three smaller things went with them, all of which the single list fixes for
// free: the age separators no longer render twice (once per column) and the two
// scroll positions no longer drift apart; the layout no longer changes meaning
// below 1200px, where the columns stacked into two headings; and the grouping
// axis is now free, which is what the lifecycle work needs — see
// needs-assets-vs-ready-to-post.html, Option E.
//
// The cards keep their own max-width, so the reading measure is unchanged. What
// is lost is density: a single capped column leaves the right of a wide window
// empty, which is exactly the space the columns existed to use. That is the
// accepted cost, not an oversight.
// ─── Infinite load ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A page is 10 topics. The next 10 arrive when the sentinel below the list comes
// into view, after a deliberate 2s — long enough that the spinner is legible in a
// demo, short enough not to feel broken. Scrolling is the ONLY trigger; there is
// no "Load more" button any more (see renderMoreSentinel).
//
// Paging is applied to the FLAT filtered list before grouping, not per age group.
// The list is already sorted newest-first, so slicing the flat list and grouping
// the slice keeps every group complete-as-far-as-it-goes: a page boundary can land
// inside "Earlier", and the heading simply gains cards on the next load rather than
// a fourth group appearing out of order.

//
// ── No button, by request: scrolling is the only trigger ───────────────────
// This was an .ap-button in its idle state and a spinner while loading. The
// argument for the button was keyboard and screen-reader access — an infinite list
// triggered only by scroll position has nothing to activate. It turns out not to
// need one: every card in the list holds a focusable kebab, so tabbing to the last
// card scrolls it into view, which brings the sentinel inside the observer's 200px
// margin and starts the load. The keyboard path is the same path, just made of
// Tabs instead of a click.
//
// So the row is now the spinner, unconditionally. There is no idle state left to
// draw: the row sits below the fold until the observer's margin reaches it, and by
// the time it is on screen a load has already begun. Rendering an idle variant
// would draw a state lasting a single frame — and the swap between the two is what
// used to make the list jump.
//
// The spinner is an EMPTY .ap-loader — archie-loader.js sweeps for the class and
// supplies the animated Archie mark, so this matches renderGenerating and every
// other spinner in the app. size-24 rather than that page's 60: a row at the foot
// of a list, not a whole-screen state.
//
// role="status" on the caption, so a screen reader is told the list is extending
// rather than finding it silently longer. It is announced once per mount of this
// element, not once per page, because the element survives the repaint that adds
// the cards (loadMore no longer paints mid-load).

           Three things left this block. The "Full article" kicker, because the pane
           has a title and a close button and sits beside the card it belongs to;
           naming itself as well was the fourth label in a 60px band. The topic
           headline, because the card carrying it is right there and highlighted, so
           the pane repeated the one line the user had just clicked. And the
           source-and-count sub, which said "Competitors · 14 posts" — the card's own
           source row says the same thing two inches to the left.

           What remains is briefTitle() — the SAME string the card shows, in the
           SAME class. That is the point: the pane must read as the thing you just
           clicked rather than as a different object.

           That string is now the ARTICLE's title everywhere (briefs-store.briefTitle).

// control as the component for flipping between two to four short co-visible
// views, which is exactly this. So it is hand-built, but from the component's
// real template and SCSS: same class names, same markup, same values. The CSS
// lives in ds-patches.css, the one place this app is allowed to add a primitive
// the CSS-UI layer forgot, and swapping in the real component is a delete.
//
// The first version was a look-alike rather than a port — a grey track with a
// raised white chip on it, the iOS shape. The DS's is an outlined button group:
// white segments, grey-20 borders sharing an edge, and a SELECTED state that
// changes border and text to electric blue rather than filling anything.
//
// The count is the one addition, and it is a DS **Counter** rather than a styled
// span. The segment option carries a label and an optional icon, so the number is
// ours to place — but not ours to draw: `.ap-counter normal` is the documented
// way this product puts a number beside a label, and it is what the nav rows use
// for the size of a set you own. The first version was a bare span with a
// font-weight override, which is the "recreate a component in raw CSS" drift the
// guidelines call out.
//
// It takes the SEGMENT's state: grey while unselected, blue when selected, using
// the DS's own two colour pairs so the number belongs to the segment it sits in
// rather than floating grey against blue text.

// ⚠️ It is a VIEW OF THE RAIL'S SCOPE, not a second scope. CLAUDE.md records that
// active-playbook.js deliberately replaced four separate Playbook pickers — the
// composer's, this feed's form, the New-pillar dialog's and /content-strategy's —
// because "any two could disagree". Picking here therefore calls
// setActivePlaybook(): the rail's switcher, this trigger, the feed, the pillar
// counters and a new chat's Playbook all keep reading one value. A local
// `view.playbook` would have put a second answer on the same screen as the first.
//
// "First Playbook selected by default" falls out of that for free rather than
// needing its own rule: getActivePlaybook() already falls back to
// getDefaultContext() || getContexts()[0], so with nothing chosen the trigger shows
// the first Playbook in the list.
//
// Markup is the composer's, part for part — .ap-select > summary.ap-select-trigger
// .composer-playbook__trigger with an inline label, then .ap-select-dropdown with
// .ap-select-option rows. The one part NOT reused is the dropdown's own class:
// .composer-playbook__dropdown pins itself with `bottom: 100%` because the composer
// sits at the bottom of the screen and has to open UPWARD. In a topbar that is
// upside down — the panel opened over the title instead of below the trigger — so
// this uses .research-playbook__dropdown, which keeps the DS's own downward
// `top: 100%`. Reused rather than re-derived: it is the same control
// answering the same question, and the composer's already carries the DS's
// details/summary behaviour, the selected check and the colour dot.

// INSIDE the scroller and scrolls away, so at scrollTop 0 the pane starts ~148px
// lower and its bottom edge lands about 70px past the fold. That was survivable
// while the pane ended in mid-paragraph; with an action footer down there it is not,
// because the control is simply not visible until you scroll.
//
// Not expressible in CSS: the pane's top moves. It starts below the feed header and
// rises to the sticky offset as that header scrolls away — 116px of travel here —

// pushes the footer off the fold at the top of the page. Two right answers, so the

// standing in the Ready-to-draft segment and the list empties with the segment
// still claiming a count. The catalogue's own rule — one pattern per problem per
// surface — decides it, and the segment wins because it is always visible.
//
// `filters.types` still exists and still defaults to both, so
// getBriefsForLane's shape is unchanged; nothing narrows on it any more.
// A PORT of the DS Filter Dropdown, like the segmented control before it.
//
// `@agorapulse/ui-components/filter-dropdown` ships Angular only —
// <ap-filter-dropdown> + <ap-filter-leaf>, no CSS-UI classes — while the intent
// lookup sends "filter dropdown" straight to it. The structure here was already
// leaf-for-leaf identical (header + chevron, collapsible options, checkboxes), so
// what the port changes is the class names and the values: 420px, the
// --comp-action-dropdown-* surface, and the leaf's own spacing. CSS in
// ds-patches.css.
//
// role="group", not the component's role="menu": its own children are menu items
// and these are checkboxes, so "menu" would promise arrow-key semantics that do
// not exist here. The label is what the DS gives it.
// LIVE sources only, which today is Competitors alone (V1 scope).
//
// The other seven are `live: false` in research-catalog.js — declared so the settings
// form can show what is coming and open the "Need that source?" modal — and a filter
// row for a source that cannot produce a topic is a control that can only ever remove
// nothing or remove everything. It also misrepresents the feed: unticking "Global
// trends" implied there were global-trends topics being hidden.
//
// briefs-store's ALL_SOURCE_IDS derives from the same LIVE set, so the panel and the
// filter agree about what "all sources" means. Without that the group would read as
// narrowed the moment it opened — a 1-id selection against an 8-id notion of full

// cannot be unticked, and the badge says why. It signposts, it does not filter.
