// ⚠️ UNREACHABLE — no route points here any more.
//
// This was the Topic-feed LIST, at /topic-feeds. With the rail's Playbook scope
// switcher there is one feed per Playbook, so /topic-feeds renders that feed
// directly (research-feed.js) and there is nothing to list. Feed creation went
// with it: a feed is implicit in a Playbook now.
//
// Kept rather than deleted because it carries the reasoning for the list shape —
// why the section resets here rather than into the last-opened feed, and why a
// list of named operations beat a merged stream. If several feeds per Playbook
// ever come back, this is the screen, not a rebuild.
//
// Content Research — the Topic-feed list, route /topic-feeds.
//
// VOCABULARY: an TOPIC FEED in the UI is a LANE in code, and an IDEA is a brief.
// CLAUDE.md has the full mapping; comments here still say lane and topic.
//
// A LANE is a named standing query: one Playbook × a set of sources × a cadence.
// This screen is the account's whole set of them, plus the empty state before any
// exist.
//
// Why a list of lanes and not a feed: /topics is the feed shape — one stream
// across every Playbook — and it is deliberately kept. Content Research answers
// the other need, several named research operations running side by side, each
// with its own sources. So the entry point has to be the set of operations, not
// their merged output.
//
// Sidebar → Content Research always resets HERE (or to the empty state), never
// straight into a feed. Landing inside the last-opened lane hides the fact that
// others exist, and the lane you want is rarely the one you left.
//
// Modelled on screens/topics.js / screens/connectors.js — flag guard, then
// teardown/paint/bind, delegated listeners, store subscriptions, teardown handed
// back to the router.
