// Content strategy — the pillar list, route /content-strategy.
//
// A PILLAR is a theme the brand keeps coming back to. This screen is the set of
// them, per account, plus the empty state before any exist.
//
// ── Why a section of its own, and not part of the Playbook ─────────────────
// A Playbook is a fact sheet: every section answers "who are you?". A pillar
// answers "what are we saying?" — and unlike a Playbook it CHANGES ON ITS OWN,
// which is the thing a fact sheet must never do. It also has to be reviewable at
// a glance and shareable with a client, which a pinned chat cannot be.
//
// This does not contradict "a settings surface must not aggregate" (CLAUDE.md):
// that rule's second clause is "…or on a route scoped to one feature", and this
// is one feature. Nothing else is re-hosted here.
//
// ── Nothing on this page is a queue ───────────────────────────────────────
// The counters count what ARRIVED, not what is waiting. There is no pending
// state to clear anywhere in this feature, so no card carries an action that
// says "deal with me" — Review is navigation, not triage.
//
// Modelled on screens/research.js: flag guard, teardown/paint/bind, delegated
// listeners, store subscriptions, teardown handed back to the router.
