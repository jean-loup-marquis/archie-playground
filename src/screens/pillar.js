//   Pillar Aggregated Context   the condensed prose Archie carries into a chat,
//                               with the diff toggle and the pencil that edits it
//   Assets                      the files you have attached
//
// ── Where the trail went ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This page used to have a second tab, "What went into it": every topic, chat and
// note, newest first, each quoted and each removable. It is now the History
// dialog (components/pillar-history-modal.js), opened from the provenance line
// under the prose.
//
// The tab was the wrong shape twice over. It sat on the OTHER SIDE of the page
// from the text it explained, so it was opened rarely and the context stayed
// unexplained; and it listed one row per input, which is not how anyone thinks
// about a weekly cadence. The dialog answers where the question is asked and
// groups by event.
//
// Removing an input went with it, deliberately. An input is a record of what
// happened; deleting it would rewrite that record to change a sentence. The
// sentence is changed by editing the context — the pencil on the section.
//
// ── Why the record still quotes every input ───────────────────────────────
// A title tells you a topic was matched. An excerpt tells you WHAT PART of it the
// pillar swallowed, which is the only thing anyone can actually judge. A note is
// the user's own text, so it is quoted whole and marked as such — the one place
// in this feature where a model must not restate the input.
