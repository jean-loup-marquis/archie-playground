// Topic feeds — the attention page, route /topic-feeds/:id/attention.
//
// The file is still research-trending.js. The route was renamed when the page
// grew to carry both signals; the module name lags, the same split as
// Playbook/Context and brief/topic.
//
// This page is the HOME of both ATTENTION SIGNALS — trending and updated — and it
// lists every brief carrying either, whatever its review status, with ONE
// exception: an IGNORED brief is never listed here.
//
// That exception reverses the rule this page was built on ("a spike must never be
// hidden because the user happened to have triaged it — an Ignored topic now
// running at 4x baseline is exactly the thing worth seeing"). Ignore now means
// ignore on every surface, and ticking Ignored in the feed's filter is the only
// way back. The exclusion lives in briefs-store's getAttentionForLane rather than
// here, so no caller can opt out of it.
//
// That is also why they aren't a section at the top of the feed. Trending was,
// once (see the handoff's explorations/): as a section it competed with the triage
// list and forced trending to override the status filter, which made the filter
// lie about what it was doing. Splitting it into a notice plus this page lets the
// feed's filter stay honest and gives both signals somewhere to be complete.
//
// Cards here are deliberately REDUCED — single Use-in-chat button, no dropdown, no
// Ignore, no status pill. See components/brief-card.js, variant "trending".
