// social-post-card — one published post by SOMEONE ELSE, shown as evidence.
//
// ── It IS the production mini-post ─────────────────────────────────────────
// The markup below is a port of `ap-mini-post` from agorapulse/platform
// (conversation/commons/frontend/libs/ui/src/lib/components/mini-post), the
// component Listening already uses to show a post in a list. Same anatomy, same
// class names, same tokens:
//
//   .mini-post
//     .mini-post-top       -left(avatar + -content(-title, -date)) · -right(action)
//     .mini-post-content   the post's text
//     .mini-post-bottom    .post-engagement — the stats run
//     [view-on]            a slot AFTER the bottom, not inside it
//
// The class names are production's rather than this component's own on purpose:
// a reader who knows the Listening card should recognise this one as the same
// object, and anything that changes there can be diffed against this file. What
// stays `social-post-card__*` is only what this surface adds — the avatar tint
// and the compact variant.
//
// Deliberately NOT top-post-card. That component resolves identity through the
// brand's own connected profiles and frames its numbers as a performance
// decision (the ×-vs-average hero, a Repurpose CTA, a permalink built from your
// own post id) — it assumes the post is yours. A competitor's or a creator's
// post has an author who isn't you, and its engagement is evidence for a claim
// rather than a metric you act on.
//
//   renderSocialPostCard(post, { compact }) → one evidence card
//
// Pure render except for ONE thing: the sentiment is a menu, so this module keeps
// the chosen values and the open state and binds a single delegated listener via
// init(). Everything else is still a function of its arguments. Post shape (see
// mocks.topics):
//   { id, network, publishedOn,
//     author: { name, handle, initials, accent }, text,
//     likes, comments, reposts }
//
// `compact: true` drops the engagement row and clamps the text to two lines —
// for when a single representative post rides inside a chat turn or a card
// footer rather than a reading surface. mini-post has no such variant; this is
// the one thing here production does not carry.
//
// NOT ported, and why: `--seen` and `--selected`, plus the hover border. All
// three are states of a card you SELECT in a triage list. The sentiment is the
// only thing here you can act on, and a whole-card hover accent would suggest the
// card itself opens something.
//
// The network mark uses the DS `-official` glyphs, which carry the brand's own
// colours baked into the icon (they're SVG data-URI backgrounds, not font
// glyphs), so nothing here has to hardcode a third-party hex.

// DROPDOWN TRIGGER — that is where its cursor:pointer, its hover ground and its
// padding come from. Without the permission it gets `ap-post-sentiment`, a plain
// read-out. This card cannot change a sentiment, so it is the read-out.
//
// The first version here ported the trigger and then stripped the interaction off
// it, which produced the right pixels for the wrong reason and left a class named
// after a menu on a card with no menu.
//
// Colours come from SENTIMENT_SETTINGS (listening/model/sentiment), whose entries
// carry the token name in a comment beside each hex — so green-150 / red-150 /
// grey-80 are its values, not ones chosen here.

// ── The sentiment, and its menu ────────────────────────────────────────────

// listening-feed-search-list-item: `ap-post-sentiment` when the reader cannot
// change the value, `ap-listening-sentiment-state-menu` when they can. This card
// is the SECOND now — the sentiment is a judgement about someone else's post and
// a reader looking at the evidence is exactly who would disagree with it.
//
// So `.sentiment-container` > `.sentiment-main-container` is back, and with it the
// cursor and the hover ground the previous pass stripped: they are what the
// trigger needs, and removing them was only right while nothing opened.
//
// The menu is the DS Action Dropdown, built from the CSS-UI classes the way the
// topic card's kebab already builds one. Production passes ActionDropdownItems
// with `startSymbolId` and `startSymbolColor: item.color`, so each row's glyph
// carries its own sentiment colour — unlike the TRIGGER, where only the label is
// coloured and the glyph stays grey. Both are deliberate and both are copied.
//
// `ap-action-dropdown__content` in the DOM you inspected is the Angular
// component's own inner element, not something the CSS-UI layer ships — the
// framework-agnostic anatomy the DS documents is `.ap-action-dropdown` holding
// `.ap-action-dropdown-item`s, which is what this builds.

//
// The ACTIONS ROW is `.post__footer-actions`, lifted from ap-post
// (commons/ui/components/post) rather than invented. mini-post's own template
// offers two separate holes — a [mini-post-sentiment] slot inside the bottom and
// a [mini-post-view-on] slot after it — and its one consumer, the screening
// modal, fills only the second, so it never had to decide how the two sit

//
//   .post__footer          column, flex-start, gap xxs   (= .mini-post-bottom)
//   .post__footer-actions  row, centre, gap xs, width 100%
//   .post__view-on         margin-left: auto
//

// `align-self: flex-end`. Stacked, it made three lines of chrome — stats, then
// sentiment, then a link on its own — under a two-line post. On one row the
// sentiment reads against the figures it belongs with, and the link keeps the
