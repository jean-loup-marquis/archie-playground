// The creative-tool three-zone layout: inputs left, canvas centre, output right,
// composer bottom. Two things fall out of it. The settings sit beside the image
// they describe instead of underneath it, and the bottom bar shrinks back to the
// one thing it should hold — the prompt — which is what let it be too wide and
// too heavy in the first place. The inspector shares the LEFT edge with edit
// mode's tool palette, so switching mode swaps the controls in place instead of
// throwing them across the modal; the chutier keeps the right edge to itself.
//
// EDIT drops the inspector and floats its three manual tools top-left over the
// canvas, at the contact point of the work (v1's arrangement, which was right).
//
// Three exported surfaces, all composed by stage-view:
//   composer(st)      the bottom console — prompt + CTAs, both modes
//   settingsPanel(st) the floating inspector (generate only)
//   toolPalette(st)   the floating tool palette (edit only)
//
// Sheets are FLAT — sections + dividers, never a nested dropdown (the ADS has no
// flyout-submenu pattern). One sheet is open at a time, tracked by
// state.openPopover — that's the EDIT-mode flyouts. The generate panel's settings
// sections are independent and live in state.collapsedGroups.

Campaign objective: Raise awareness about the risks of unmediated AI in UX design and establish the line between acceleration and shortcuts.
Audience: UX/UI Designers, Product Managers, Tech Leaders
Tone: Professional, provocative, authoritative

Title: AI can easily ruin your UX
Key message: Velocity is useless if you are building the wrong things faster. Human oversight is non-negotiable.
Narrative purpose: Grab attention immediately with a provocative statement and a striking visual metaphor of speed leading to chaos.
Visual goal: Create an instant visual metaphor for speed without direction or acceleration leading to product degradation.
Visual scene: A deep blue background. On the left, massive bold typography. On the right, a single powerful graphic: a thick, horizontal orange arrow representing velocity. The tail of the arrow is solid and perfectly defined, but as it points forward, the tip shatters and dissolves into a chaotic cloud of tiny, disconnected digital pixels and glitch fragments.
Composition focus: The transition point of the arrow where order turns into digital chaos, aligned with the bold headline.`;

// One setting = one DS Accordion section, expanding IN PLACE inside the panel.
//
// This replaced a stack of `.ap-select` triggers that threw flyout sheets over
// the image. Sections are the better tool for three reasons: the options land
// next to the label they belong to instead of across the canvas, nothing has to
// be positioned (no flyout can fall off an edge), and with no sheet needing to
// escape it the panel is finally free to scroll — the `overflow: auto` trap that
// bit this file three times simply stops existing.
//
// `.ap-accordion` brings the frame, the header row, the title, the toggle and
// its 180° rotation on `.collapsed`.
//
// NOT an accordion in behaviour, despite the DS class: a section the user opened
// stays open, and opening a second doesn't shut the first. One-at-a-time kept the
// panel short, but it also meant you could never see two settings at once and
// every section you'd opened shut itself behind your back. State lives in
// `collapsedGroups` — the same Set v1's composer already used, so the two studios
// track section state identically and `openPopover` goes back to meaning only what
// its name says: the edit-mode flyouts, which ARE one at a time.
//
// `pinned` opts a row out of that: it is always expanded and never collapses, so
// its header stops being a control — a static row rather than a <button>, with no
// chevron and no toggle hook. Nothing to press means nothing that can mislead, and
// it never enters `collapsedGroups` at all. The value still rides in the header:
// with the body open it is a summary of what's below ("Acme · 3") rather than a
