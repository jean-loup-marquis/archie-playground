// Image Studio v2 — shared runtime context for the split modal modules.

// the state engine (src/image-studio.js) is a Map(key → state), so v1 and v2 can
// be mounted side by side (both init() at boot) without sharing a byte of state.
// Only one studio is open at a time, so a single KEY plus a mutable `ctx`
// (populated by index.js on open) is all the sibling modules need.
