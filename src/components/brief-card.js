// topics-card — one research brief, summarised, in a lane's feed.
//
// Pure render, no store reads: the screen resolves the source and passes it in,
// so the card stays a function of its arguments and can be rendered in the feed,
// the trending page or a modal without knowing where its data came from.
// Interaction is delegated — every hook is a data-* attribute.
//
//   renderBriefCard(brief, { source, variant }) → one card
//
// ── variant: "feed" | "trending" | "picker" ─────────────────────────────────
// The trending page's cards are DELIBERATELY reduced: Use in chat becomes a single
// button with no dropdown, Ignore disappears, and so does the status pill. That
// page answers "what's spiking", not "what have I triaged" — showing triage
// controls there invites the user to work a queue that isn't one.
//
// "picker" is the Pick-a-topic modal, and its card BODY is now the feed's, part
// for part: badge, source, age, status glyph, pillar mark, Trending/Updated,
// headline, summary. The modal used to show a compact one-line row of its own, so
// the thing you picked looked nothing like the thing you had been reading two
// seconds earlier; the pillar mark was the last thing still telling them apart.
//
// What the variant still changes is BEHAVIOUR, not content: the body carries
// data-idea-read rather than data-brief-research (the dialog opens the article
// inside itself, not in a side pane beside a list), there is no aria-expanded
// because nothing is being disclosed next to it, and there is no kebab — the
// picker offers one verb, and it lives in the article's own footer.
//
// It used to be true that "in a picker the card IS the control", with the body
// carrying data-idea-pick. That is what justified stripping things out of it, and
// it stopped being true when the pick moved to the article footer — where the
// reader has actually read the thing they are choosing.
//
// ── Two signals that must never read as peers ───────────────────────────────
// A filled pill unambiguously means REVIEW STATUS in this app. Trending is
// therefore PLAIN TEXT with an icon, never a pill: as a pill it read as a fifth
// status, and trending is an independent boolean that coexists with all four.
//
// ── A trending card has no frame accent, and never had a span ───────────────
// Trending cards once carried a peach border plus a 4px orange rail on top.
// Both are gone: the signal lives inside the card, in the "Trending" mark and
// the orange-railed "Why now" block, which is how Updated already worked. Two
// signals, one grammar.
//
// The history still matters if an accent ever comes back. It began as an
// absolutely-positioned 4px span inside an overflow:hidden wrapper and caused
// three bugs: it clipped the Use-in-chat dropdown, and because overflow:hidden
// zeroes a flex item's automatic minimum size, the column's default flex-shrink
// crushed the cards and cut their footers off. A border is the only safe way to
// draw one. flex:0 0 auto in research.css is the other half of that fix and is
// still load-bearing — don't undo it.

// paragraph, became one line, and is now the shortest thing that still carries the
// rule: ignoring is not deleting — the Ignored filter brings it back. A spike no
// longer does.
//
// "this list", not "feed": the user is standing in ONE Topic feed when they read
// it, and that is the scope of what ignoring does. "Feed" was ambiguous with the
// /topics feed, which is a different surface with a different object in it.
// "Baseline" went earlier for length; the full version still lives where the

// (research-modals.openIgnoreReason).

// is. The feed opens on To review, so this is also the sentence that tells the
// reader they will see it again without changing a filter.
const UNIGNORE_HINT = "Back on this list to review";

// ── The ROUTE TAG WAS HERE, and it is gone ─────────────────────────────────
// `renderRouteTag()` drew an .ap-tag naming the topic's type (Ready to post /
// Content strategy) on the left of the meta run. It existed to tell you which
// verb the card's SPLIT BUTTON would lead with — and the split button went when
// the card lost its footer. The card's menu now shows every verb at once, so the
// label predicted nothing.
//
// The argument it carried is worth keeping because it was right about its own
// question: with exactly two types, labelling only the exception costs more than
// the extra chip saves, because reading a route off an ABSENCE is work. If a
// route label ever comes back — on a filter chip, in the menu header, anywhere —
// label both types, not just one.
//
// What is lost, and is not free: the route still drives the ORDER of the menu
// rows, and that is now invisible until the menu is open. `typeTagColor` in
// research-catalog.js now has NO callers — left in place beside the catalogue it
// belongs to rather than deleted, because it is the colour half of the mapping
// and a route label returning without it would be reinvented wrong.

// The status, as one glyph. It was a filled pill carrying the word.
//
// Why the pill went: it was the widest thing in the meta row and it stated the
// least. Three of the four values are things the reader themselves did, so the row
// spent its most valuable horizontal space telling them their own last action —
// while the two things they could NOT know without being told, Trending and Updated,
// sat to its left competing for the same strip. A glyph says the same thing in 16px
// and stops competing.
//
// The tooltip is where the words went, and it says MORE than the pill did: the pill
// said "Ignored", the tooltip says what being ignored does to the topic.
//
// The DS Tooltip, not a title attribute — title waits a second, cannot be styled and
// renders in OS chrome. Structure follows session.js's starter-topic tip, the app's
// existing use of this component: the bubble sits AFTER its trigger so a plain
// adjacent-sibling selector reveals it, and visibility lives on the APP class,
// never on .ap-tooltip, because redeclaring a DS class outside ds-patches.css flips
// the cascade for every other use of it.
//
// aria-hidden on the bubble, with the label AND the hint on the trigger's aria-label:
// a display:none element cannot be read through aria-describedby, so the accessible
// name has to carry the explanation itself.
// What a claim rests on: what was counted, then what it was counted against. One
// function so no two surfaces can phrase the same comparison differently — the card,
// the article and the chat all read from here.

         "Full research" button was removed it is the ONLY way in, which is why it
         must stay a button and stay the whole text area. The actions sit
         outside it in a sibling footer. A button inside a button is invalid HTML
         and the browser resolves the nesting unpredictably, which is the same
         reason topic-card splits body from footer.

         It carries data-brief-research — the exact attribute the footer's "Full
         research" button already uses — so both screens' existing handlers pick
         it up with no new wiring. In the picker it carries data-idea-read: a
         different attribute for the same verb, because the picker's dialog opens
         the article INSIDE itself rather than in the feed's side pane.

         It used to carry data-idea-pick — the card was the control, and clicking
         it chose the topic there and then. That asked the reader to decide from
         two clamped lines of summary; the pick moved to the article's own footer,
         where they have just read the thing they are choosing.

         Everything inside is a <span>, not the h3/p it was: a button may only
         contain PHRASING content, so a heading or paragraph in here is invalid.
         topic-card made the same trade for the same reason. The classes are
         unchanged, so the styling carries over; the spans are given display:block
         in brief-card.css where they relied on being block elements. -->

// Feed: a split button. The main segment carries the action the topic's ROUTE
// implies; the chevron opens the rest.
//
// ── The main segment is not one verb any more ───────────────────────────────
// A Ready-to-post topic can go to a writer, so the default is Use in chat. A
// Needs-assets topic cannot — its blocker is a commitment, a shoot or a customer
// who will go on record — so its default is Add to strategy. This is the whole
// point of Option B: the route stops being a label you read and becomes the
// button you press, which is the only version of it that changes what happens.
//
// Neither action is ever hidden. A Content-strategy card keeps "Use in chat
// anyway" as its first menu row, and that row IS the correction — there is no
// separate "reroute this topic" step.
//
// A reroute row existed and was removed. It changed the topic's stored type, so
// it needed a store mutation that wrote onto server-owned data, and it asked the
// user to relabel a topic in order to do something with it. "Use in chat anyway"
// gets them straight to the thing they wanted, one click instead of two.
//
// The trade is real and worth naming: the classification is now OVERRIDABLE but
// no longer CORRECTABLE. If Archie files a topic wrongly it stays filed wrongly
// — the label simply stops blocking anyone. Fine while the label costs nothing to
// ignore; revisit if a mislabel ever carries a consequence beyond this card.
// ─── PARKED: Add to strategy ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// The Content-strategy / pillar flow is parked, not deleted. Everything it needs
// is still here — briefs-store, contexts-store's pillar API, the dialog in
// research-modals.js, the Playbook section in playbook-view.js, the composer item
// in screens/session.js. Only the ways IN are commented out, in five files, each
// marked "PARKED".
//
// To restore this card, put these two expressions back (they are written without
// template syntax on purpose — a backtick or a dollar-brace in a comment inside
// the html literal below would end or interpolate it):
//
//   main segment attribute:
//     ready ? data-brief-use=ID : data-brief-strategy=ID
//   main segment label:
//     ready ? "Use in chat" : "Add to strategy"
//   first menu row:
//     ready ? a data-brief-strategy row labelled "Add to strategy"
//           : a data-brief-use row labelled "Use in chat"
//   plus the standalone data-brief-save row that always followed it.
//
// While parked, Save for later is promoted from that standalone row to the main
// segment for content-strategy topics, because Add to strategy was the only thing
// there and a topic still needs one verb of its own.
/**
 * The article pane's footer: the split button's three actions, laid out flat.
 *
 * Same three verbs the card's split offers, no chevron and no menu. The card needs
 * the menu because it is one of ten in a scrolling column and can spare one button's
 * width; the footer is 620px of pane with nothing else in it, so hiding two of three
 * actions behind a chevron was spending a click to save space that was already free.
 *
 * Dropping the menu also retires two things the split needed and this does not: the
 * `article:<id>` menu key that kept the footer's dropdown from opening the card's,
 * and the upward-opening rule that stopped it being clipped by the pane's
 * overflow: hidden. Fewer moving parts for the same three actions.
 *
 * Real .ap-button, not the card's hand-rolled .topics-use__main — the segments only
 * hand-roll it because a split needs a squared inner edge the DS does not expose, and
 * three separate buttons have no such constraint. The weights carry the hierarchy the
 * menu used to carry by position:
 *
 *   primary orange the main verb. Orange is the AI / spotlight colour in this app,
 *                  and taking a topic into a chat is the AI action the pane exists
 *                  to set up. It was stroked blue, matching the card's parked split
 *                  button — but with the split gone there is nothing left to match,
 *                  and three stroked buttons gave the pane no obvious next step
 *   ghost grey     Ignore. It sits NEXT TO Use in chat rather than pushed to the far
 *                  right: with only two buttons left, the gap read as a missing third
 *                  one, and a control alone at the opposite edge of a 620px pane looks
 *                  like it belongs to the pane rather than to the topic. Grey, not red —
 *                  ignoring hides a topic the Ignored filter brings back, so the
 *                  destructive colour promises a consequence it does not have. Ghost
 *                  keeps it from reading as a second equal choice.
