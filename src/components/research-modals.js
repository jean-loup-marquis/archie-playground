       .ap-dialog-close is position:absolute against the dialog, and .ap-dialog-header
       reserves padding-right:64px so a title cannot run under it; the two never share
       a flex row. The Angular API says the same thing twice over: closable and
       headerVisible are independent inputs, so a dialog with no header still has
       its close button, in the same corner.

       Here it was an in-flow flex child of the head, and that inversion cost two
       patches. The three article views hide their header text, which used to mean
       .sr-only — position:absolute — on the title block, so the flex item doing the
       pushing left the flow and the button snapped to the top-LEFT corner; that
       needed a margin-left:auto. And an empty header still reserved a band, so it
       needed its padding shrunk. Out of the flow, both problems stop existing

// a different rule than the feed does; "3 days ago" is the thing you actually
// scan a topic list by, and the picker had no reason to disagree.
//
// The lane's NAME is gone from the cards too. It moved onto the meta line back
// when a Playbook could own several feeds and this was the one surface that
// spanned them — one feed per Playbook, and a picker scoped to one Playbook,
// means every card in this list now carries the same string. What does not change

// takes as `playbookId`. A second control here could only agree with the composer's
// (making it redundant) or disagree with it (making the modal show topics from a
// brand the chat is not in). The composer's own Playbook select is where that
// choice is made now; this list just follows it.
//
// What the select DID carry, besides the choice, was the brand's name — and losing
// that broke the rule that a scope which hides has to stay legible where it
// filters. It matters more here than it did: the chat's Playbook can now differ

  // ── A "Topics for later" topic has no write-up, and says so ───────────────

  // was written up because the scan gave enough to write from; a Topics-for-later one
  // was not, and printing four paragraphs of prose for it would present the same
  // artefact for both — the reader could not tell which they were holding, and would
  // draft from a write-up the model never actually stood behind.
  //
  // So the body becomes an empty state that names the gap, and the rest of the pane
  // stays exactly as it is: Topic Relevance still says how much backed it and why now,
  // the history still says when it arrived, and Sources still lists the posts. Those
  // are what the scan DID produce, and they are what a reader needs to judge whether
  // their own assets close the distance.
  //
  // The two ways out are the two that actually exist: bring assets to it in a chat
  // (the pane's own primary, "Use in chat"), or leave it for a later run to grow. No
  // third invented affordance, and no button of its own here — the footer's primary is
  // the action this copy names, and a second orange button two inches above it would
  // be the same verb asking twice.
  // ONE EXCEPTION, and it turns on the topic carrying a `basis` rather than on which
  // source produced it: the discriminator is the property that makes the difference,
  // not a hardcoded source id. A measured topic — one that says what it counted and
  // what against — was written up by the scan, because the numbers ARE the scan's
  // output and they exist whether or not the brand has assets lying around. Its
  // reason for sitting in Topics-for-later is not a missing write-up, it is that a
  // finding about the mix is a decision before it is a post, and its last paragraph
  // says so. Showing "not enough data" over a claim that just quoted 32 posts would

    <!-- ── The DS Status component, and nothing hand-built around it ───────────
         This list used to draw three things the DS already ships. All three are gone:
           • .topics-status — a hand-rolled pill (3px 10px, radius 24, 11px/800,
             uppercase, four hardcoded --ref-color fills) that re-created .ap-status.
             The three review statuses map 1:1 onto its variants, so nothing was
             gained by drawing it: grey / blue / red, from statusColor in
             research-catalog.js.
           • .research-timeline__dot — a 22px circle with a 3px white ring, filled
             with the PILL's background token. .ap-status carries its own 8px dot by
             default, coloured from --comp-status-*-dot-background-color, so the app's
             version was a second drawing of one idea in the wrong colour.
           • the row's ::before rail — a 2px connector at left:10px, top:22px, every
             number derived from that dot's geometry, so the dot could not change size
             without silently breaking the line. It carried no meaning the <ol> and the
             dates do not already carry.
         What is left is one flex row per entry. The <ol> stays: this is an ordered
         sequence of events and the markup should say so. -->
