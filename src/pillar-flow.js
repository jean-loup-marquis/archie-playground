// Launches the in-chat interaction for a Playbook's content pillar.
//
// The same shape as brief-flow.js, and for the same reason: two surfaces start
// this and they sit on opposite sides of a navigation.
//
//   • The composer's Add menu ("Post about a Content Pillar") is ALREADY inside a
//     chat, so it calls attachPillarToChat(session.id, …) directly — no handoff,
//     no navigation, the pillar lands in the thread you are looking at.
//   • The pillar dialog on /playbook has no chat to attach to, so it calls
//     openPillarInChat(), which arms the handoff and navigates to a fresh one.
//
// Both end in the same attach, which is the point of the split: "Use in chat"
// means one thing whichever surface you press it from, exactly as it does for a
// topic.
//
// A pillar arrives as an already-processed SOURCE. Nothing new had to be built
// for it — intake-lifecycle turns it into a source-intake card in the thread, and
// every affordance the app already has (Extract ideas, Draft a post, Ask about
// it, the Sources panel) lights up on its own.
//
// Version pins MUST match screens/session.js's for sources-stream and
// contexts-store — each keeps module-local state, and a second copy at a
// different URL would keep its own. scripts/bump-cache.py --audit enforces it.
