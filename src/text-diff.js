// Word-level diff, for showing what a rewrite did to a piece of prose.
//
// The pillar's aggregated context is generated: a weekly run or a user edit
// replaces text nobody else holds a copy of, so the only way to trust the result
// is to see what moved. This is what "Show what changed" renders.
//
// WORD level, not character: a character diff on prose marks the inside of words
// and reads as corruption. Not sentence level either — a run that changes three
// words in a paragraph would mark the whole paragraph and say nothing.
//
// The algorithm is a plain LCS over whitespace-separated tokens. Quadratic in the
// token count, which is fine for a paragraph and would not be for a document;
// both sides here are capped by what a pillar's context can hold (a few hundred
// words). If that stops being true, this is the seam to swap for a real diff.
//
// Public API:
//   diffWords(before, after) → [{ type: "same" | "del" | "ins", text }]
//   renderDiff(before, after) → HTML string with <del> / <ins>
