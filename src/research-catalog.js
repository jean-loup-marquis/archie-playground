// Content Research sources catalog — what Archie watches inside one research lane.
//
// CONFIG, not content: it ships with the app and must exist in `new-alt` mode
// too (a brand-new user still sees all eight source cards on the research form).
// The briefs those sources produce are content and live in mocks.js, empty for a
// new user. Same split as ff-catalog.js (config) vs mocks.js (data).
//
// ── Why this is NOT topics-catalog.js ───────────────────────────────────────
// The two catalogues overlap by six source names and diverge on everything
// structural, so they stay separate files:
//
//   • Scope — Topics config is PER PLAYBOOK (`ctx.topics`), because /topics is
//     one stream across every Playbook. Content Research config is PER LANE, and
//     a lane is itself (Playbook × sources). Folding one into the other would
//     force a lane to inherit its Playbook's Topics toggles, which is exactly
//     the coupling lanes exist to break.
//   • Cadence — Topics ships Daily / Weekly / Monthly. The handoff specifies
//     Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly. Both are correct for their own surface, so
//     neither catalogue can own the other's list.
//   • Count — Content Research adds two sources Topics does not have: Internal
//     team ideas, which reads connected MCP tools rather than social listening,
//     and Brand website, which reads the Playbook's own site.
//
// Merging them was considered and rejected: it would have meant a shared list
// with per-surface exclusions and two cadence arrays, which is more branching
// than two flat files.
//
// `accent` is a SEMANTIC KEY, never a hex — the view maps it to the shared
// `.topic-badge--<accent>` class that resolves DS colour tokens. Reused rather
// than reinvented: topic-badge is already the source-tile primitive on three
// surfaces, and a source tile means the same thing here.
//
// `live` — false means the source is not built yet. Toggling it opens the
// "Need that source?" feedback modal and leaves the switch untouched, rather
// than pretending it works. Only competitor-posts is live.
//
// `playbookAnchor` — never the id — says which Playbook section a source reads,
// so the card can offer "Edit my competitors in the Playbook" without
// hardcoding a source id. null = Agorapulse listening feeds it directly and the
// Playbook has nothing to do with it.
//
// `howItWorks` is plain informative prose. It began life as a greyed-out
// read-only textarea; that read as a broken input, so it is now text. Do not
// reintroduce a disabled input here.
//
// Descriptions and howItWorks are written in a NEUTRAL, passive register — "every
// post is read", not "I read every post".
//
// Archie speaks in the first person everywhere it is TALKING to you: the thread,
// the toasts, the empty states. This is settings copy, and settings copy explains
// what the system does when nobody is watching. In the first person the same
// sentences read as promises made in conversation ("I only raise a theme once ten
// people have voiced it"), which is the wrong register for a switch you set once
// and leave running for months.

  // market; this one watches what the brand itself published and how it did — so

  //
  // That difference is why it leads the list: a lane's own results come before the
  // market's. It is also why the topics it produces carry a `basis` (see mocks.js) —
  // a claim about your own numbers has to say what it counted, which is the one

// action the footer will offer, and inferring it from an ABSENCE is a worse
// trade than one extra chip.
//
// Colour: green for postable, grey for not-yet. Green is the DS house rule for
// "a validated / approved object", which is exactly what Draft-ready claims.
// Grey is the neutral. Deliberately not orange and not blue — in this app those
// are action colours, and a category is not an action; not red, which means

//
// ⚠️ Both fills are shared with a status chip, and there is no way around it.

// Trending is deliberately absent — it is an independent boolean on the brief,
// not a status. A brief can be Saved AND trending, or Ignored AND trending, so
// the two can never share one field.
// `icon` and `hint` were added when the card's status stopped being a pill and
// became a glyph. Both belong HERE rather than in the card: the feed's Filters
// panel shows the same pair, and two copies of "which icon means saved" would
// drift the first time one changed.
//
// THREE icons, not four — New deliberately has none. See the New entry below.
// Every icon that IS here is OUTLINE, deliberately: bookmark_fill and
// rounded-check_fill both exist and either would read as "more applied" on its own,
// but mixed weights in one set make the set look like two sets. Uniform stroke, and
// the tooltip carries the meaning.
//
// `hint` is a sentence, not a restatement of the label. A tooltip that says "Saved"
// over an icon labelled Saved is a tooltip that has told you nothing; each one says
// what the status MEANS for the topic.
//
// `statusColor` is the DS .ap-status variant this status renders as, and it lives HERE
// for the same reason `icon` does: two copies of "which colour means Ignored" would
// drift the first time one changed. The three map 1:1 onto the DS's own variants, so
// nothing here invents a colour —
//
//   new → grey      (not yet answered)
//   used → blue     (the DS's info / neutral colour)
//   ignored → red   (the taking-away one)
//
// Used is BLUE and green is NOT free: green is taken by the Draft-ready tag and
// .ap-tag green computes the identical fill, so two chips in one row would share a
// colour meaning different things. The house rules also give Status blue as
// "info / neutral-info", and Used records that the topic went somewhere, not that it
// went well — which is what green claims.
//
// Both fields are OPTIONAL. Every consumer already skips a status without an icon
// (the card renders nothing, the Filters option row omits the glyph, the legend
// filters the list), so leaving them off is how a status opts out of the marker.

    // nobody anything. "To review" is the one thing that separates this state from

    // marker cannot say, and it was the most common value in the lane — so the feed
    // spent a glyph on almost every row to convey nothing.

    // Sparkles was tried and is what prompted this: it is the app's AI mark, and
    // every topic in the feed is Archie's, so it separated this state from nothing.

    // on most rows, competing with Trending and Updated, the two marks in that row
