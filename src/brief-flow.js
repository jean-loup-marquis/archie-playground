// Launches the in-chat interaction for a Topic feed topic.
//
// "Use in chat" is the forward action on a topic, and it now means the same thing
// from every surface that offers it: the topic opens a chat of its own with itself
// attached as a SOURCE. Rather than invent a downstream surface, it reuses the one
// the app already has — so Extract ideas, Draft a post, Ask about it and the
// Sources panel all light up with no new plumbing.
//
// Two halves, because the entry point and the arrival sit on opposite sides of a
// navigation. This is the same shape topic-flow.js uses for /topics, and it exists
// as its own module for the reason topic-flow does: FOUR surfaces now start this
// flow — the feed's card footer, the attention page's card, the new-session
// starter card, and the composer's Pick-a-topic modal — and three of them cannot
// import from screens/session.js.
//
//   • openBriefInChat(briefId)          — arm the handoff and navigate to a fresh
//     chat, pre-bound to the topic's Playbook and named after its headline (both
//     via query params, which session.js already reads when minting a `new-*`
//     session).
//   • attachBriefToChat(sessionId, id)  — consumed at session mount: attach.
//
// Unlike /topics there is no echo message and no question picker. The
// source-intake card already names the topic and the composer is right there; a
// sentence repeating the headline was the same fact twice.
//
// Version pins MUST match screens/session.js's for sources-stream and
// briefs-store — each keeps per-session state in a module-local Map, and a second
// copy at a different URL would keep its own. scripts/bump-cache.py --audit
// enforces it.
