// Briefs store — what Archie found inside a lane, plus how the user triaged it.
//
// GLOBAL and lane-keyed, like research-store: a brief arrives on a cadence and
// belongs to a lane, not to a chat.
//
// ── The one invariant this store exists to protect ──────────────────────────
// `status`, `isTrending` and `isUpdated` are SEPARATE FIELDS and must stay that
// way. Neither signal is a fifth status; both are independent booleans. A brief
// can be Saved AND trending, New AND updated, or all three at once. Every
// consumer therefore reads three things, and no code path may write either
// signal into `status`.
//
// The consequences the views depend on:
//   • In the FEED, a trending brief shows under its own status — a trending New
//     brief appears only when "To review" is ticked and vanishes when it isn't.
//     Trending is not a feed-level override. (This is the whole reason trending
//     moved out of a collapsible feed section: as a section it had to override
//     the status filter, which made the filter lie.)
//   • An IGNORED brief is never surfaced by a signal, anywhere. Ignore now means
//     ignore: the only way to see one is to tick Ignored in the filter. The old
//     rule — "a spike is never hidden by triage state", which let the trending
//     and attention pages show ignored briefs — is gone. It made Ignore a
//     suggestion rather than an answer, and the one thing a reader wants from
//     "not this one" is that it stays gone.
//
// Triage is kept in its own map rather than written onto the brief, mirroring the
// handoff's data model: a Brief is what the scan returned (server-owned), a
// Triage row is what this user did with it (user-owned). Keeping them apart means
// a re-scan can replace briefs without clobbering triage.
//
// Public API:
//   getBriefsForLane(laneId, filters?) → Brief[]  (newest first, filtered)
//   groupBriefsByAge(briefs)           → [{group, briefs}] in AGE_GROUPS order
//   getTrendingForLane(laneId)         → Brief[]  (ignores the status filter)
//   getAttentionForLane(laneId)        → Brief[]  (trending OR updated, deduped)
//   countTrendingForLane(laneId)       → number   (whole lane, filter-blind)
//   attentionCountsForLane(laneId)     → {trending, updated, total} flagged in the lane
//   countNewForLane(laneId)            → number   (the lane card's NEW badge)
//   getBriefById(id)                   → Brief | null
//   getStatus(briefId)                 → 'new'|'saved'|'used'|'ignored'
//   getIgnoreReason(briefId)           → string
//   setStatus(briefId, status)         mutates + notifies
//   toggleSaved(briefId)               → the resulting status
//   ignoreBrief(briefId, reason)       mutates + notifies
//   unignoreBrief(briefId)             back to 'new', reason cleared
